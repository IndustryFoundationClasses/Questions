####Why?
[I](https://github.com/theoryshaw) started the Linkedin [Industry Foundation Classes Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/3690870) a number of years ago with the intention of creating an open, low-barrier place where anyone could ask (or publicly view) any type of question (answer) as it relates to IFC standards and development.

Due to [recent news](http://marketingland.com/linkedin-is-making-all-linkedin-groups-private-starting-oct-14-145530), however, Linkedin has created an unfortunate fiction barrier to this open access to information.

In this light, this Github repo was created to act as more public and fiction-less place to ask these questions.

Secondly, being that Github is inherently for software development, it's native tools will undoubtedly prove helpful drilling into specific code and content.
